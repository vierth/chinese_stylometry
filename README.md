# chinese_stylometry
This repository contains various Jupyter notebooks pertaining to the use of stylometric analysis for Chinese literature. These notebooks were originally created for my DHAsia workshop at Stanford in February 2016.

Feel free to use them and modify them for your own research, but please cite this repository.
